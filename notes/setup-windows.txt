pyenv was installed using instructions README of the following repo:
https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#pyenv-win-commands

poetry was installed using pipx using instructions from https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#initialising-a-pre-existing-project
in addition PATH had to be set to the value: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts
for poetry to get the version set from pyenv you have to run:
poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true

poetry init -n
(if versions still dont match, change in file and run poetry update)
poetry add packagename
foreach ($pkg in Get-Content requirements.txt) { poetry add $pkg }-windows

$Env:MPLBACKEND = "TkAgg" in powershel if an error durring import occures
poetry add $(cat requirements.txt)-linux
